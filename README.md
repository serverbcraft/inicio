# Portal
A portal template created with Twitter Bootstrap for Minecraft servers

Portal is a <b>barebones</b> template made to rapidly create responsive portal pages for Minecraft servers. Setup is very easy, and only requires you to replace a few images, add some links, and modify a couple of padding/margin settings to get the site looking right for your icons and logo.

The template also includes floating particles with the <a href="https://github.com/motyar/firefly">jQuery firefly</a> plug-in, and load animations with the <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">animate.css</a> library. The included logo and background are from my server, <a href="http://ts-mc.net/">The Storm</a>. The icons are from <a href="https://craftilldawn.com/">CraftTillDawn</a>. The template uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> for responsive features.

Screenshot of template. Note that by itself it's pretty plain/bland, especially with small icons.
